# go-gusanos
Golang recreation of [gusanos](https://github.com/wesz/gusanos), the Liero clone.

## Plan

1. Recreate gusanos game with the modern toolset, and publish builds for at least Linux, Mac OS and Windows.

2. Don't try to rewrite existing code, just go with the 'create new game' mindset, and reference original whenever it's needed.

3. Maintain backwards compatibility with all the existing mods to gusanos, and, as the original, with legacy Liero maps.

4. Continuous refactor, hopefully documentation.

5. Take my time.

6. Every legit pull request is more than welcome.
