### Mods
The subjects to preserve are mods - full sets of content for game, with original gusanos being the base of it. A single mod consists of:
- maps,
- sprites,
- weapons,
- sounds,
- objects,
- fonts,
- gui,
- scripts,
- mapeffects,
- configuration files.

### OMFGScript
Mods configuration files were written using a OMFGScript, a simple script language, looking similar to Lua and potentially having some connections with (but I'm unaware of any at the moment of writing this), created just for the gusanos game by it's original creators. It's crucial to have its implementation in go-gusanos version, to unlock all of the modding features the original game had.
